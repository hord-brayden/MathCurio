## Noting a unit circle equivalence 

$\sqrt{\frac{1}{\Pi}}$ which equates out to a circle with radius of $\approx 0.5641895835477563$ Which will be referred to as $\mathit{R}(\alpha)$

Upon further examination, one can continually extend the original radius of $\mathit{R}(\alpha)\times\mathit{n}$ to find $\mathit{n}$'s radius. Which can then be unfolded using the standard formula to find the area of a circle:
- $\mathit{R}(\alpha)=\pi\mathit{r}^2$
- E.G: Where $\mathit{n}=2$; $\mathit{R}(\alpha)\times 2 	\approx 1.1283791670955126$
- Therefore $\Pi\times 1.1283791670955126^2 = 4$ 
- E.G.D: Where $\mathit{n}=6712$; $\mathit{R}(\alpha) \times 6712 	\approx 3786.84048477254$ 
- Therefore $\Pi\times 3786.84048477254^2 = 45050944$
  
Also of note; this can be used in a compound scenario: 
- $(\mathit{R}(\alpha) \times 17) + (\mathit{R}(\alpha) \times 220) = (\mathit{R}(\alpha) + 237)$
We can conclude that $\mathit{R}(\alpha)\times\mathit{n}$ is increasing the circle by the next possible square of $\mathit{n}$. A nice fact, but otherwise unremarkable.
  
The Formula should be: $\sqrt{\frac{1}{\Pi}}\times \mathit{n} = \mathit{n}^2$
